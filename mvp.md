Based on the sources and our conversation history, here is a recommendation for a simple, buildable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of this product:

Drawing on the identified feature gaps and pain points, a simple and buildable MVP should focus on the **core capability of automated defect detection and basic data extraction**. This directly addresses the need for enhanced defect detection and the significant lack of an automatic data extraction process from large datasets, which are highlighted as key issues.

Here is a proposal for an MVP:

- **Automated Detection of Specific, Major Defects**: The MVP would focus on **detecting and initially classifying one or two primary types of road defects**. Potholes and major cracks are logical targets as they are common defects and significant causes of complaint and cost. The MVP would aim for **detection from full-scale images** (like dashcam or smartphone video) rather than only top-view surfaces or clipped images, as this is identified as a needed future study area and a gap in current solutions. While deep learning shows promise for precise detection, addressing the challenge of **detecting cracks from images containing obstacles** like grass, shadows, cars, or pedestrians would be a key area of focus for robustness.
- **Automated Basic Data Extraction and Georeferencing**: Once defects are detected, the MVP would automate the **extraction of their location (georeferenced) and the detected defect type**. This directly addresses the noted **lack of an automatic data extraction process** from road mobile mapping systems and their large datasets. Automating this extraction is necessary to convert high-speed data acquisition into relevant information. To keep it simple for an MVP, it could include only a **very basic severity classification** (e.g., simply "present" or potentially "major" vs. "minor" for the detected defect types), deferring more detailed severity levels or classifying all types of distress for later iterations.
- **Simple, Usable Data Output**: The output of the MVP would be a **simple, usable data export**, such as a CSV file or similar structured data format, containing the georeferenced location and basic type/severity of the detected defects. This helps users (like local authorities) utilize the data immediately, addressing some of the challenges related to data availability and usability mentioned in the pain points. A basic map interface could potentially be included to visualize these data points, but the core value lies in the automated data extraction.

**Rationale for this MVP Focus**:

- **Focuses on Core Capability**: Defect detection and data extraction are fundamental to any road monitoring system and directly address the problem of poor road conditions.
- **Addresses a Significant Pain Point**: The lack of automated data extraction is a key hurdle in transforming high-speed data collection into actionable information for asset condition and performance assessment. Providing this capability delivers immediate value.
- **Manageable Scope**: Limiting the detection to specific defect types and simplifying classification and data output makes the initial build more manageable compared to addressing the full range of identified gaps, such as comprehensive platform integration, automated inventory for _all_ assets, advanced predictive maintenance, or integration with crowdsourced data.
- **Delivers Immediate Value**: By automatically providing a georeferenced list of detected defects, the MVP directly assists organizations in identifying and documenting problems within their road network, a necessary step for addressing poor road conditions and improving monitoring and planning. This helps bridge the gap in reliable and consistent data on road conditions.

This MVP would lay a solid foundation by demonstrating the feasibility and value of automated detection and data extraction from visual sources, a highly sought-after capability in the road maintenance space.
